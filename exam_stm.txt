The web server will be accessible only through the internal network.
Commands:
bash
Copy code
# Install Apache (CentOS):
yum install httpd -y

# Install Apache (Ubuntu):
apt update && apt install apache2 -y
Explanation:
•	yum and apt are package managers for CentOS and Ubuntu, respectively.
•	httpd and apache2 install the Apache web server.
________________________________________
3. Configure Apache to Listen on Private IP
Edit the Apache configuration file to restrict it to the private interface.
Commands:
bash
Copy code
# Open configuration file:
vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  # For CentOS
vim /etc/apache2/ports.conf    # For Ubuntu

# Add or modify the Listen directive:
Listen 10.0.0.101:80
Save and restart Apache:
bash
Copy code
# Restart Apache:
systemctl restart httpd   # CentOS
systemctl restart apache2 # Ubuntu

3.	Port: Use the default 1194.
4.	Protocol: Choose UDP.
5.	DNS: Select a DNS resolver (e.g., AdGuard DNS).
________________________________________
5. Transfer .ovpn File to Client
After installation, transfer the generated .ovpn file to the client.
Commands:
On the server:
bash
Copy code
scp /root/<client-name>.ovpn 192.168.206.134:/root/
On the client:
bash
Copy code
apt install openvpn -y
openvpn --config /root/<client-name>.ovpn
________________________________________
6. Install OpenVPN Access Server
For a web-based management interface, install OpenVPN Access Server.
CentOS Commands:
bash
Copy code
yum -y install centos-release-scl-rh
yum -y install https://as-repository.openvpn.net/as-repo-centos7.rpm

Introduction to Snort
Snort is a powerful open-source tool for network security, serving multiple roles:
1.	Packet Sniffer: Captures packets on a network.
2.	Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.
3.	Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): Actively blocks malicious traffic.
Use Cases of Snort in IPS Mode
•	Real-time Threat Mitigation: Snort detects and blocks harmful network activity.
•	Customizable Rules: Administrators can create custom rules tailored to their specific security needs.
•	Cost-effective Security: Open-source and widely supported, Snort is a budget-friendly option.
Snort Modes
1.	Packet Capture Mode
o	Command: snort -i eth0
o	Used to capture raw network traffic on a specific interface.
2.	IDS Mode
o	Detects and logs suspicious activity.
3.	Inline (IPS) Mode
o	Actively blocks malicious traffic based on configured rules.

Overview of Snort Rules:- Snort rules are divided into two main sections:
1.	Rule Header: Specifies the action, protocol, and source/destination details.
2.	Rule Options: Contains detailed criteria for matching traffic and specifies the alert message.
Basic Syntax:
<action> <protocol> <src_ip> <src_port> -> <dst_ip> <dst_port> (msg: "<message>"; sid: <ID>; rev: <revision>; other options...)
________________________________________
Rule Header Breakdown
1.	Action:
o	Specifies what Snort should do when traffic matches the rule. Common actions:
	alert: Generate an alert.
	log: Log the packet.
	pass: Ignore the packet.
	reject: Block the traffic and send a response (used in IPS mode).
	drop: Block the traffic without sending a response (IPS mode).
2.	Protocol:
o	The network protocol to monitor, e.g., tcp, udp, icmp, or ip (any protocol).
3.	Source IP and Port:
o	Specifies where the traffic originates. Use any to match all IPs or ports.
o	Format: <src_ip> <src_port>.
4.	Direction Operator:
o	Indicates the direction of traffic flow:
	->: Unidirectional (from source to destination).
	<->: Bidirectional (source and destination can swap roles).
¬¬
5.	Destination IP and Port:
o	Specifies where the traffic is headed. Similar format to the source.

Step 3: Writing and Testing Custom Rules

Example 1: Detect Any IP Packet
Add this rule to /etc/snort/rules/local.rules:
	alert ip any  any  ->  any  any (msg: "IP Packet detected"; sid: 10000; rev:1;)
  Explanation:
•	alert: Action to generate an alert.
•	ip: Matches all IP traffic.
•	any any -> any any: Matches traffic from any source IP and port to any destination IP and port.
•	(msg: "IP Packet detected"; ...): Log message when the rule is triggered.
•	sid: 10000: Unique Snort rule ID (must be > 1000000 for local rules).
•	rev:1: Revision number of the rule.
Test Command:
	snort -A console -q -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
This runs Snort in quiet mode (-q) on interface eth0  (change interface as per your one) and outputs alerts to the console (-A console).






Example 2: Detect ICMP (Ping) Packets
Rule:
	alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "ICMP Packet detected"; sid: 10001; rev:1;)

•	Explanation:
o	icmp: Monitors ICMP protocol traffic (used for ping and error messages).
o	$HOME_NET: Matches your internal network (defined in snort.conf).
o	msg: "ICMP Packet detected";: Logs this message when triggered.
•	Use Case: Detect unauthorized ping attempts to your network.


Example 3: Detect FTP Connections
Rule:
	alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 21 (msg: "FTP Connection Detected"; sid: 10002; rev:1;)
•	Explanation:
o	tcp: Monitors TCP protocol traffic.
o	any any: Matches traffic from any source IP and port.
o	$HOME_NET 21: Matches traffic directed to port 21 (FTP port) on the home network.
o	msg: "FTP Connection Detected";: Logs an alert when traffic matches this rule.
•	Use Case: Monitor FTP activity to prevent unauthorized file transfers.



Advanced Options
Example 4: Detect SYN Packets
Rule:
	alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (flags: S; msg: "SYN Packet Detected"; sid: 10003; rev:1;)
•	Explanation:
o	flags: S;: Matches packets with only the SYN flag set. SYN packets initiate TCP connections.
o	msg: "SYN Packet Detected";: Logs this message for matching packets.
•	Use Case: Monitor for potential port scanning or DoS attempts.
________________________________________
Example 5: Match Specific Content
Rule:
	alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg: "SSH Attempt"; content: "SSH"; sid: 10004; rev:1;)
•	Explanation:
o	tcp: Monitors TCP traffic.
o	$HOME_NET 22: Matches traffic targeting port 22 (SSH).
o	content: "SSH";: Matches packets containing the string SSH.
•	Use Case: Detect and log unauthorized SSH login attempts.
________________________________________
Note:-  Adding Rules to Snort
All custom rules should be added to the local.rules file:
sudo vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
1.	Write your rule in the file.
2.	Save and exit.
________________________________________
Validating Custom Rules
Before running Snort with custom rules, test the configuration:
snort -T -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
•	Output:
o	If successful, Snort reports that the configuration is OK.
o	If errors exist, they will be highlighted for correction.
________________________________________
Logging and Alerts
Console Logging:
To display alerts on the console:
	snort -A console -q -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
File Logging:
To log alerts to a file:
	snort -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -l /var/log/snort
•	Logs will be saved in /var/log/snort.

Benefits of Snort Inline Mode
1.	Real-time Blocking: Prevents malicious activity immediately.
2.	High Customizability: Tailor-made rules for specific threats.
3.	Comprehensive Threat Analysis: Logs all traffic for forensic analysis.
________________________________________




Writing a Detection Rule for LFI
Objective:
Detect malicious requests attempting to exploit Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities, such as accessing sensitive files like /etc/passwd.
________________________________________
3.1: Writing the Rule
Open the Snort local.rules file to define a custom rule:
sudo vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Detection Rule:
var HTTP_WEB_SERVERS [x.x.x.x, x.x.x.x]
var HTTP_PORTS [80, 443]

	alert $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HTTP_WEB_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"LFI Attack detected"; content:"../"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
Explanation:
1.	Variables:
o	HTTP_WEB_SERVERS: Specifies the IPs of web servers you are protecting. Replace x.x.x.x with the actual IP(s) of your server(s).
o	HTTP_PORTS: Monitors traffic on standard web ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
2.	Rule Header:
o	alert: Generates an alert when the rule matches.
o	$EXTERNAL_NET any: Matches any traffic originating from an external network.
o	->: Indicates traffic directed toward the web servers ($HTTP_WEB_SERVERS).
o	$HTTP_WEB_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS: Matches requests targeting web servers on the defined ports.
3.	Rule Options:
o	msg:"LFI Attack detected";: Specifies the alert message.
o	content:"../";: Matches requests containing directory traversal patterns (../), a common technique in LFI attacks.
o	sid:1000001;: Assigns a unique Snort rule ID.
o	rev:1;: Revision number of the rule.
________________________________________
3.2: Testing the Rule
Run Snort with the updated rules to monitor traffic on the specified interface (e.g., ens33):
sudo snort -A console -q -i ens33 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
•	Test URL:
	http://domain.tld/index.php?file=../../../etc/passwd
•	If the rule is properly configured, Snort will generate an alert when the above request is detected.
________________________________________



Potential Bypass and Detection Enhancement
Problem: LFI Bypass via URL Encoding
An attacker might obfuscate the directory traversal payload using URL encoding:
•	Encode . as %2E and / as %2F.
•	Example payload:
http://domain.tld/index.php?file=%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
•	Result: The original detection rule may fail to match this request.
Solution: Enhance the Rule to Detect Encoded Payloads
Modify the local.rules file to include patterns for URL-encoded traversal:
Updated Detection Rule:
bash
Copy code
alert $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HTTP_WEB_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"LFI Attack detected (encoded)"; content:"%2E%2E%2F"; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
Explanation:
•	content:"%2E%2E%2F";: Matches URL-encoded traversal sequences (../ encoded as %2E%2E%2F).
Additional Rule: For broader detection, include a rule for mixed payloads:
	alert $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HTTP_WEB_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"LFI Attack detected (mixed encoding)"; content:"../"; nocase; pcre:"/(\.\.|%2e)(\.\.|%2e)\//i"; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
•	nocase: Makes the content match case-insensitive.
•	pcre: Adds a regular expression to match patterns that mix normal and encoded traversal (../ or %2E%2E%2F).
________________________________________
3.4: Testing Bypass Detection
Run Snort again and test with encoded URLs:
http://domain.tld/index.php?file=%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2F%2E%2E%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
If configured correctly, the enhanced rules will generate alerts for both plain and encoded payloads.
________________________________________
3.5: Hardening the Rule
1.	Log Detailed Alerts: Include more descriptive messages:
msg:"Possible LFI attack detected - Encoded traversal";
2.	Combine Multiple Patterns: Use pcre to combine plain and encoded patterns:
pcre:"/(%2e%2e%2f|\.\.\/)+/i";
3.	Traffic Profiling: Use $HTTP_PORTS and $HOME_NET variables to limit scope, reducing false positives.
________________________________________
3.6: Logging Alerts
Store alerts for review:
sudo snort -i ens33 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -l /var/log/snort
Review logs:
cat /var/log/snort/alert





Installation and Configuration for Inline Mode [IPS]
Step 1: Install DAQ (Data Acquisition Library)

Step 2: Configure DAQ for Inline Mode
1.	Verify Available DAQ Modules:
	snort --daq-list
Output will include:
     Available DAQ modules:
    pcap(v3): the default mode, used for sniffer and IDS modes
    nfq(v7): inline on Linux netfilter
    ipfw(v3): used with divert sockets with the pf & ipfw firewalls
    dump(v3): allow testing of online
    afpacket(v5): on Linux using two bridged interfaces
2.	Copy DAQ Files to Snort Directory:
	cp -av ~/daq-2.0.7 /etc/snort/
3.	Edit Snort Configuration File:
	vim /etc/snort/snort.conf
Uncomment and modify the DAQ configuration as follows:
config daq: afpacket
config daq_dir: /etc/snort/daq-2.0.7
config daq_mode: inline
config daq_var: buffer_size_mb=512
Explanation:
•  daq: Specifies the DAQ module to use (afpacket for inline processing).
•  daq_dir: Path to the DAQ library directory.
•  daq_mode: Sets inline mode for IPS.
•  daq_var: Configures additional parameters such as buffer size.
Step 3: Create Rules for Inline Mode
1.	Edit Local Rules File:
	vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Add the following rule to detect and drop ICMP packets:       IPS  (Prevention)
	drop icmp $HOME_NET any -> any any (msg:"ICMP detect and drop"; sid:1000001; rev:1; classtype:icmp-event;)
Explanation:
•	drop: Drops packets matching the rule, preventing them from reaching their destination.
•	icmp: Matches ICMP packets.
•	$HOME_NET: Monitors traffic originating from your internal network.



Step 4: Test and Run Snort in Inline Mode
1.	Test the Configuration:
snort -T -i eth0:eth1 -Q -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
o	Flags:
•  -T: Test mode.
•  -i eth0:eth1: Specifies the two interfaces bridged by afpacket.
•  -Q: Enables inline (IPS) mode.
1.	•  -q: Quiet mode, suppresses non-critical output.

Run Snort Inline:
	snort -A console -q -Q -i eth0:eth1 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
o	-A console: Logs alerts to the console.
________________________________________
Verification
•	Ensure that snort -T completes successfully without errors.
•	Simulate ICMP traffic (e.g., ping) and confirm Snort drops packets as per the rule defined in local.rules.
________________________________________
This guide ensures all steps are complete and correct for setting up Snort in Inline Mode (IPS) with proper configurations and verification.



If you only have one interface (e.g., eth1) but want to add another interface (e.g., eth2) for Snort in inline mode, you’ll need to simulate or configure a second interface on your system. Here's how you can do it step by step:
________________________________________
Adding and Configuring Another Interface
Step 1: Check Existing Interfaces
Run the following command to see available interfaces:
	ip link show
If you only see eth1 and no additional interface, proceed to create a new virtual interface.
________________________________________
Step 2: Create a Virtual Interface
You can create a virtual interface using Linux utilities like ip or ifconfig. Here's how:
Using ip Command:
sudo ip link add name eth2 type dummy
sudo ip link set eth2 up
Using ifconfig (Older Systems):
	sudo ifconfig eth2 up
Explanation:
•	type dummy: Creates a dummy interface, which acts like a real interface but doesn't require actual hardware.
•	set eth2 up: Activates the virtual interface.
________________________________________
Step 3: Bridge the Interfaces
To use Snort in inline mode, the interfaces (e.g., eth1 and eth2) must be bridged. This allows traffic to pass through both interfaces.

Create a Bridge:
sudo brctl addbr br0
sudo brctl addif br0 eth1
sudo brctl addif br0 eth2
sudo ip link set br0 up
Explanation:
•	brctl addbr br0: Creates a bridge interface called br0.
•	brctl addif: Adds eth1 and eth2 to the bridge.
•	ip link set br0 up: Activates the bridge.
________________________________________
Step 4: Update Snort Configuration
Edit the Snort configuration file to include the bridge interfaces:
sudo vim /etc/snort/snort.conf
Ensure the DAQ section is configured for inline mode with both interfaces:
config daq: afpacket
config daq_mode: inline
config daq_var: buffer_size_mb=512
________________________________________
Step 5: Update Local Rules
Add a sample rule to monitor traffic across the new interface:
sudo vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Example Rule:
drop icmp $HOME_NET any -> any any (msg:"ICMP detect and drop"; sid:1000001; rev:1; classtype:icmp-event;)
________________________________________
Step 6: Test the Configuration
Run Snort in test mode to verify the setup:
sudo snort -T -Q -i eth1:eth2 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Explanation:
•	-T: Test the configuration.
•	-Q: Enable inline mode.
•	-i eth1:eth2: Specify both interfaces.
________________________________________
Step 7: Start Snort in Inline Mode
Run Snort with both interfaces:
sudo snort -A console -q -Q -i eth1:eth2 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
________________________________________
Summary of Key Steps
1.	Create a Virtual Interface:
o	Use ip or ifconfig to create an additional dummy interface (e.g., eth2).
2.	Bridge the Interfaces:
o	Use brctl to bridge eth1 and eth2 for traffic monitoring.
3.	Configure Snort:
o	Update the Snort configuration file to include both interfaces.
4.	Test and Run:
o	Test with -T and run in inline mode using -Q.

To test the "Nmap SYN Scan Detection" rule you provided, follow these steps:
________________________________________
1. Verify Suricata Configuration
•	Ensure Suricata is installed and properly configured.
•	Check that the local.rules file is included in your Suricata configuration:
bash
Copy code
sudo vim /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
Confirm the local.rules path is listed under rule-files:
yaml
Copy code
rule-files:
  - local.rules
________________________________________
2. Add the Custom Rule
•	Edit the local.rules file:
bash
Copy code
sudo vim /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
•	Add the rule to detect SYN scan packets:
php
Copy code
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (flags:S; msg:"Nmap SYN Scan Detected"; sid:100001; rev:1;)
________________________________________
3. Reload Suricata Rules
•	Update and reload Suricata to apply the new rule:
bash
Copy code
sudo suricata-update
sudo systemctl restart suricata
________________________________________
4. Perform SYN Scan
•	Use Nmap to perform a SYN scan on the Suricata-monitored server:
bash
Copy code
nmap -sS <ec2-instance-ip>
Replace <ec2-instance-ip> with the IP address of the EC2 instance or server running Suricata.
________________________________________
5. Check Suricata Logs
•	Monitor Suricata logs to verify if the alert is triggered:
bash
Copy code
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
Look for entries like:
css
Copy code
[**] [1:100001:1] Nmap SYN Scan Detected [**]
________________________________________
6. Debugging and Verification
•	If the alert does not appear:
o	Check the Suricata service status:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status suricata
o	Ensure the $HOME_NET variable is properly defined in suricata.yaml. It should include your EC2 instance's IP or subnet.
o	Verify if the Nmap SYN scan is reaching the Suricata instance:
bash
Copy code
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp and tcp[tcpflags] & 2 == 2
This captures SYN packets arriving on the monitored interface.
By following these steps, you should successfully detect and log Nmap SYN scans using your custom Suricata rule.

Here’s a step-by-step guide that you can follow to create the Snort rule for detecting the specified traffic and conditions. You can copy and paste these commands directly to implement the rule.
________________________________________
1. Create or Edit the Snort Rule File
•	Open the Snort rule file in a text editor:
bash
Copy code
sudo vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
________________________________________
2. Add the Custom Snort Rule
•	Add the following rule to detect the specified conditions:
snort
Copy code
alert udp [10.0.0.0/8,1.0.0.0/24,196.2.3.0/16,8.8.8.8] any -> 192.168.82.0/24 53 (msg:"DNS data triggered"; content:"thisissometempspace whoiscool"; flags:!S; classtype:bind; priority:8; sid:100002; rev:1;)
Explanation:
•	alert: Specifies the rule type.
•	udp: Specifies UDP traffic.
•	[10.0.0.0/8, 1.0.0.0/24, 196.2.3.0/16, 8.8.8.8]: Source IP addresses (external networks).
•	any: Any source port.
•	->: Arrow indicating direction (from external to internal).
•	192.168.82.0/24: Destination IP address (internal network).
•	53: Destination port (DNS service).
•	content: Matches the exact string "thisissometempspace whoiscool".
•	flags:!S: Ensures the packet has no SYN flag set.
•	classtype:bind: Classifies the rule as "bind".
•	priority:8: Sets the priority to 8 (higher alert priority).
•	sid:100002: Unique Snort ID for the rule.
•	rev:1: Revision number for the rule.
________________________________________
3. Save and Close the Rule File
•	Press Esc, then type :wq and press Enter to save and exit the file.
________________________________________
4. Update Snort Configuration (if needed)
•	Ensure that Snort is using the correct rule file (local.rules). Check if it’s included in the Snort configuration (snort.conf):
bash
Copy code
sudo vim /etc/snort/snort.conf
•	Ensure there is a line similar to this:
bash
Copy code
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
________________________________________
5. Restart Snort to Apply the Rule
•	Restart the Snort service to apply the changes:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart snort
________________________________________
6. Test the Rule
To test the rule, you can simulate traffic that matches the rule:
1.	Simulate DNS request with custom content:
o	You can use tools like Scapy or Hping3 to simulate UDP traffic with content that matches the rule, or simply generate DNS traffic on the required port.
2.	Generate traffic using dnsperf (or any other DNS tool), ensuring the string "thisissometempspace whoiscool" is present in the payload.
3.	Check Snort Alerts:
o	You can monitor Snort’s alert logs for the generated rule matches:
bash
Copy code
sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/alert
o	Look for alerts with the message "DNS data triggered".
________________________________________
7. Debug and Verify
If the rule doesn't trigger as expected:
•	Ensure that the traffic you’re testing matches all conditions (correct IP, ports, UDP, and content).
•	Check the Snort status:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status snort
•	Check the Snort logs for errors:
bash
Copy code
sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/snort.log
By following these steps, you'll successfully create and test your Snort rule for DNS data with the specified conditions.

bash
Copy code
nmap -sS <target_ip>
Replace <target_ip> with the IP address of your Snort-monitored server.
Example:
bash
Copy code
nmap -sS 192.168.1.10
2. Test for Access to /admin Pages
Use curl or a browser to simulate access to an /admin page:
bash
Copy code
curl http://<target_ip>/admin
Replace <target_ip> with the IP of your web server.
Example:
bash
Copy code
curl http://192.168.1.10/admin
3. Test for FTP Failed Login
Use an FTP client and enter incorrect credentials:
bash
Copy code
ftp <target_ip>
Replace <target_ip> with the IP address of your FTP server.
Example:
bash
Copy code
ftp 192.168.1.10
Once connected, provide incorrect username/password to trigger the failed login.
4. Test for HTTP Packets
Use curl to send an HTTP request:
bash
Copy code
curl http://<target_ip>
Replace <target_ip> with the IP address of your web server.
Example:
bash
Copy code
curl http://192.168.1.10
Monitoring Alerts
After running these test commands, check the Snort alert logs to confirm your rules are triggering correctly:

bash
Copy code
sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/alert
Optional: Generate Heavy Traffic with Nmap
For additional testing:

Nmap Service and Version Detection:
bash
